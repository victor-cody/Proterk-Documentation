# Introduction to Protekt

Protekt is an **API-first authentication and identity management platform** that helps developers add secure login, user management, and access control to their applications without having to build authentication from scratch.

Instead of spending weeks designing login flows, token handling, and compliance checks, you can integrate Protekt in minutes using our SDKs, APIs, and pre-built UI components.

## Why Protekt?

Building authentication is complex and error-prone. Developers face challenges like:

- **Security risks**: Handling passwords, tokens, and encryption incorrectly leaves apps vulnerable.
- **Time to market**: Implementing secure authentication can take weeks away from core product features.
- **Scalability**: As apps grow, managing sessions, rate limits, and multiple environments gets harder.
- **Compliance**: Standards like GDPR, SOC2, and OpenID Connect require ongoing maintenance.

Protekt solves these problems by offering:

- üîí **Security by default** ‚Äî Built-in encryption, token rotation, and industry-standard compliance.
- ‚ö° **Fast integration** ‚Äî Quickstarts and SDKs for popular frameworks (Node.js, Python, React, iOS, Android).
- üåç **Flexibility** ‚Äî Support for username/password, passwordless login, multi-factor authentication, and social providers (Google, GitHub, more).

## High-Level Concepts

Before you dive in, here are a few core ideas that will help you understand how Protekt works:

- **API-first design**  
  Everything in Protekt is accessible via our REST APIs and SDKs. Whether you‚Äôre building for the web, mobile, or server-side, you can integrate authentication consistently.

- **Authentication flows**  
  Protekt supports common flows such as:  
  - **OAuth 2.0** ‚Äî Secure delegated access.  
  - **OpenID Connect** ‚Äî Identity layer on top of OAuth.  
  - **Passwordless** ‚Äî Magic links or one-time codes for frictionless login.  
  - **MFA** ‚Äî Add an extra layer of security with TOTP or push notifications.

- **Tokens**  
  Protekt issues **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)** to represent user sessions. Tokens contain claims about users and can be refreshed automatically through our APIs.

- **User Management**  
  Out of the box, Protekt provides user registration, password resets, social logins, and role-based access control (RBAC).
